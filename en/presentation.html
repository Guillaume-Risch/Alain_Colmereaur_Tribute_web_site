        <p class="text">
            Alain Colmerauer is known as a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence and
            the author of the famous programming language Prolog. He was a
            mathematician and a computer scientist, a tireless and visionary
            researcher, who very quickly identified the need to move away from the
            traditional programming system and towards a logical approach.  <br><br>
            
            In 1969 at Montreal University he developed “Q systems”, a formalism
            suited for processing natural languages, which was the predecessor of
            Prolog. The first Prolog interpreter was written in 1971 at Marseille
            University. <br><br>
            
            This first academic success brought Prolog and its creator to the
            attention of many universities and research centers, and the language
            was spread all over the world. Prolog II introduced constraint logic
            programming, while Prolog III and Prolog IV apply the solving technique
            of constraints resolution and intervals propagation to discrete and
            continuous domains. This last development, partly unfinished, was the
            last one of the long line of his Prologs and of his life. <br><br>
            
            Prolog development and applications illustrate perfectly the kind of
            scientist he was: always concerned with theory as well as practical
            implementations. <br><br>
            
            Three years after his death, this tribute will recall his important
            scientific contribution and will showcase the links between his work and
            the research still going on today. In a context that has become
            particularly active due to the recent development of numerical
            techniques in AI, we will have an update of the symbolic approaches that
            have historically founded AI research at Marseille. We expect this day
            to be an opportunity for evoking last research developments in the
            field.
